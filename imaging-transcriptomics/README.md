# imaging transcriptomics ðŸ§¬ðŸ§ 

Imaging transcriptomics refers to a nascent field that tries to generate hypotheses about molecular and cellular mechanisms that underly macroscale brain aberrations. This is done by spatially comparing the microscale regional abundance of specific genes (or cells derived from marker gene expression) with the macroscale aberration patterns observable via MRI. The idea is that the severity of a disease-induced change depends on certain tissue properties (e.g., presence of astrocytes or presence of dopamine receptors) which can be estimated by gene expression. An impressive validation of this method was demonstrated by [Jakob Seidlitz](doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17051-5).
By now, the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/) is the only source of regional gene expression that covers the whole brain.

Since interpretation of the individual gene-level is demanding, imaging transcriptomics branched into a field where the AHBA is used to estimate regional abundance of canonical cell types. This facilitates the interpretation of findings and eases the analysis.
