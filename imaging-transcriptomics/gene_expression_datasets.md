# Gene expression datasets 

There are several gene expression datasets available now that can be used for imaging transcriptomics. The most prominent one and the one with best spatial coverage so far is the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/).
I have compiled a (probably uncomplete) list of further gene expression datasets, also spanning brain development and other species in the Excel file in this folder.
Feel free to contribute to this list by adding more datasets or by adding more information to the existing datasets by opening a pull request!

Some more resources that concern the general topic of gene expression in the human brain are:
- [PsychENCODE projects](https://www.psychencode.org/home): impressive collection of high-quality research on gene expression in the human brain. They have also released two of the atlases you find in the Excel file.
- [Table 2 in Arnatkeviviute 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.10.016) also presents a good overview of gene expression resources.
