# Prematurity ðŸ¤°

## Definitions and overview ðŸ’¬
Preterm birth is defined as being born before the 37th week of gestation. It can be further subdivided into very preterm birth (i.e., before the 32nd week) and extreme preterm birth (i.e., before the 26th week). Although mortality after preterm birth declined over the last decades, morbidities are still high.
