# Prematurity ü§∞

## üí¨ Definitions and overview 
Preterm birth is defined as being born before the 37th week of gestation. It can be further subdivided into very preterm birth (i.e., before the 32nd week) and extreme preterm birth (i.e., before the 26th week). Although mortality after preterm birth declined over the last decades, morbidities are still high.

## üë∂ Basics of brain development 
At the time of preterm birth, the brain is in a phase of complex and rapid development. In order to understand the consequences of preterm birth, you should know the most important steps of brain development.

## ü¶† Pathomechanisms after preterm birth 
After preterm birth, several adverse reactions take place in the brain. Preterm birth is often followed by hypoxia and ischemia in the preterm brain, which subsequently leads to primary injury in the white matter and secondary trophic and maturational consequences in white and gray matter [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1474-4422(08)70294-1). Joseph Volpe sheds light on the interaction between these destructive events after preterm birth and the developmental instances co-occurring with prematurity. He suggests several mechanisms of primary injury (e.g., death of pre-oligodendrocytes, axonal injury), which is followed by further secondary consequences (e.g., hypomyelination).

Moreover, there are estimates that up to 45% of preterm infants suffer from cerebellar and germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage and subsequent brain injury. Terrie Inder has summarized it in [this](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmra2303347) review. 


## üì∏ MRI findings after preterm birth
Preterm brain impacts brain development. Interestingly, these consequences last into adolescence and adulthood, which is one focus of our lab. See some example findings by our group in preterm-born 26-year old adults:
- Alterations of white matter:
	- [Altered gray‚Äêto‚Äêwhite matter tissue contrast](https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14320)
	- [Altered Gray Matter Cortical and Subcortical T1-Weighted/T2-Weighted Ratio](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2022.02.013)
	- [Aberrant cortico-thalamic structural connectivity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2021.04.009)
- Alterations of grey matter:
	- [Decreased amygdala volume](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84906-2)
	- [Altered cortical thickness](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25172)
	
An important [meta-analysis by Claire Kelly and colleagues](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105082) investigating brain changes in preterm adults has found that subcortical lesions seem to be widespread, i.e., the thalamus, amygdala, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum are affected, whereas cortical aberrations seem to be regionally specific, mostly affecting the lateral temporal cortex.
