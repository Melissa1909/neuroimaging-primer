## üêç Programming with python
This text is also in the main README, but also fits here (and is really recommended to be read üòâ)
There is some statistical software to perform neuroimaging analyses such as [SPSS Statistics](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics) that is really helpful. However, a license is required and workflow automation is not straightforward. Since big data becomes more important in neuroimaging and you will need Python for some imaging software anyways, I **really** recommend to learn some programming with Python. It allows you to handle big datasets (e.g., with pandas), to statistically analyze data (e.g., using scipy or sklearn), to nicely visualize your results (with matplotlib and seaborn), and even to directly work with neuroimaging data (e.g., nibabel). There are plenty of open source courses to learn it and your learning curve will be steep at the beginning. You will benefit from the skills early on and see some results!

Alternatively, Matlab and/or R are also powerful programming languages that are widely used in neuroimaging research. Knowing one programming knowledge allows you to more quickly and easily learn others - the concepts are mostly very similar.
