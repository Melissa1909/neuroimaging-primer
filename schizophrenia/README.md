# Schizophrenia ðŸ§ 

## ðŸŽ¤ Listening to patients
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder with a life-time prevalence of about 1% [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3360). 
Several clusters of symptoms can be at hand: positive (e.g., psychosis, delusions), negative (e.g., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive (e.g., attention or executive function deficits). In contrast to negative and cognitive symptoms that are relatively stable across the lifespan, positive symptoms substantially vary across a patient's life course. Based on this, episodes of psychosis and psychotic remission can be defined. 
To get a glimpse into the disorder, I have collected some sources that demonstrate the wide spectrum of the disorder and the difficulties it might or might not entail for patients' daily lives:

### ðŸ§¬ Genetics of schizophrenia
With an estimated heritability of 80%, understanding the genetic background of the disorder is important for deciphering biological mechanisms. To date, only about 40% heritability can be explained by known genetic variants. 
Schizophrenia is highly polygenic, i.e., many genes and loci with a small effect have been identified. Furthermore, genetic findings have revealed a close relationship with other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders.
