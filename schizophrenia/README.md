# Schizophrenia ðŸ§ 

## ðŸŽ¤ Listening to patients
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder with a life-time prevalence of about 1% [1](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3360). 
Several clusters of symptoms can be at hand: positive (e.g., psychosis, delusions), negative (e.g., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive (e.g., attention or executive function deficits). In contrast to negative and cognitive symptoms that are relatively stable across the lifespan, positive symptoms substantially vary across a patient's life course. Based on this, episodes of psychosis and psychotic remission can be defined. 
To get a glimpse into the disorder, I have collected some sources that demonstrate the wide spectrum of the disorder and the difficulties the disorder entails for patients' daily lives: 
- [Impressive TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbagFzcyNiM&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) by a woman with schizophrenia showing the stigmas that surround patients in their daily lives
- [Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oS4iGdJ9wA&ab_channel=DieFrage) with a schizophrenia patient (in German)
