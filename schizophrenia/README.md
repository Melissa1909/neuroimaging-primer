# Schizophrenia ðŸ§ 

## ðŸŽ¤ Listening to patients
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder with a life-time prevalence of about 1% [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3360). 
Several clusters of symptoms can be at hand: positive (e.g., psychosis, delusions), negative (e.g., anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive (e.g., attention or executive function deficits). In contrast to negative and cognitive symptoms that are relatively stable across the lifespan, positive symptoms substantially vary across a patient's life course. Based on this, episodes of psychosis and psychotic remission can be defined. 
To get a glimpse into the disorder, I have collected some sources that demonstrate the wide spectrum of the disorder and the difficulties it might or might not entail for patients' daily lives: 
- [Impressive TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbagFzcyNiM&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) by a woman with schizophrenia showing the stigmas that surround patients in their daily lives
- [Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oS4iGdJ9wA&ab_channel=DieFrage) with a schizophrenia patient (in German)

## ðŸ§  MRI findings in schizophrenia
- [Overview about the disorder](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3360) 
- [Neuroimaging in SCZ: an overview of findings and implications for synaptic change](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-022-01426-x) 

Although the dopamine system is highly implicated in positive symptoms of the disorder, it fails to explain all clinical features by far. Schizophrenia seems to have no neuroanatomical specificity and seems to be a disorder of neuronal (in particular synaptic) function.

A central hypothesis in schizophrenia research is the dysconnectivity hypothesis. It posits that schizophrenia results from brain structural and functional connectivity abnormalities. For example, thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensory regions has been related to hallucinations and delusions [1](https://doi.org/10.1017/s003329171800003x), while hypoconnectivity with prefrontal regions has been associated with multiple symptom domains [2](https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291722002793).

Another important concept is the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, which suggests that the disorder is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that disrupt normal brain development.

### ðŸ§¬ Genetics of schizophrenia
With an estimated heritability of 80%, understanding the genetic background of the disorder is important for deciphering biological mechanisms. But genomic findings so far explain only 40% of heritability, demonstrating the high complexity of the disorder; as [Owen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-02293-8) put it "schizophrenia and other psychiatric, cognitive and behavioural traits are amongst the most polygenic of all human traits", [citing others](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.07.003). 
Schizophrenia is highly polygenic, i.e., many genes and loci with a small effect have been identified. Furthermore, genetic findings have revealed a close relationship with other conditions, particularly bipolar disorder and childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders.
